# Overview
This is a final project conducted as part of the **[Microprocessor Applications Engineering]** undergraduate course at Kookmin University.\
The project involved the development of a Hangman game for guessing the spelling of English words, utilizing the ATmega128 Microprocessor Unit (MCU) and Putty. The USART (Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) was employed to enable communication between the PC and the MCU. In addition to the basic game functions, several additional features were implemented using various components.
