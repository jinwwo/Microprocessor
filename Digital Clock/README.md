# Overview
This is a midterm project conducted as part of the [Microprocessor Applications Engineering] undergraduate course at Kookmin University.\
The project involved the creation of a digital clock capable of displaying time in a 24-hour format, utilizing the ATmega128 Microprocessor Unit (MCU). The basic functions include the display of hours, minutes, and seconds, with several additional features implemented using the C programming language.
